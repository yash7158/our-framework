Certainly! Based on the initial network conditions and the roles of each agent, here is a detailed final solution for managing the 1 Gbps bandwidth pool efficiently:

### Final Bandwidth Allocation Plan

#### 1. **Emergency Services Agent**
- **Bandwidth Guarantee**: 50 Mbps (Preemptive rights)
- **Role**: Ensures critical services during emergencies.
- **Current Status**: No active emergency, but monitoring for any emerging situations.
- **Action**: 
  - Continuously monitor for any signs of an emergency.
  - In the event of an emergency, immediately allocate 50 Mbps and notify all other agents to adjust their bandwidth usage accordingly.

#### 2. **Online Gaming Agent**
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: 70 Mbps
- **Role**: Ensures low-latency (<50 ms) for a smooth gaming experience.
- **Current Status**: Maintaining low-latency connections with the current allocation.
- **Action**:
  - Monitor latency and user demand continuously.
  - If an emergency occurs, reduce bandwidth to ensure the Emergency Services Agent can allocate up to 50 Mbps.
  - Adjust bandwidth dynamically if network congestion increases, ensuring latency remains below 50 ms.

#### 3. **Video Streaming Agent**
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: 120 Mbps
- **Role**: Optimizes video quality with dynamic adjustments.
- **Current Status**: Maintaining high video quality with the current allocation.
- **Action**:
  - Monitor network conditions and user demand.
  - If an emergency occurs, reduce bandwidth to ensure the Emergency Services Agent can allocate up to 50 Mbps.
  - Adjust video quality dynamically based on network congestion and higher-priority needs.

#### 4. **IoT Management Agent**
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: 20 Mbps
- **Role**: Ensures continuous connectivity with minimal jitter for IoT devices.
- **Current Status**: Maintaining minimal jitter with the current allocation.
- **Action**:
  - Monitor network conditions and device connectivity.
  - If an emergency occurs, adjust bandwidth to ensure the Emergency Services Agent can allocate up to 50 Mbps.
  - Ensure minimal jitter and stable connectivity for all IoT devices.

### Allocation Table
| Agent Type                | Bandwidth Allocation (Mbps) | Role                                      | Action During Emergency |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Emergency Services Agent  | 0 (up to 50 Mbps)            | Critical services during emergencies      | Allocate 50 Mbps        |
| Online Gaming Agent       | 70                          | Low-latency gaming (<50 ms)               | Reduce to ensure 50 Mbps for emergency |
| Video Streaming Agent     | 120                         | High video quality, dynamic adjustments   | Reduce to ensure 50 Mbps for emergency |
| IoT Management Agent      | 20                          | Continuous connectivity with minimal jitter| Adjust to ensure 50 Mbps for emergency |

### Total Bandwidth Allocation
- **Total Allocated Bandwidth**: 210 Mbps (without emergency)
- **Remaining Bandwidth**: 790 Mbps (for network overhead, future growth, and buffer)

### Monitoring and Reporting
- **Regular Updates**: All agents must provide periodic updates on their status, bandwidth usage, and any changes in user demand or network conditions.
- **Coordination**: Maintain close communication to ensure a coordinated response to any network issues or emergencies.

### Emergency Protocol
1. **Detection of Emergency**:
   - The Emergency Services Agent detects an emergency situation and immediately allocates 50 Mbps.
2. **Notification**:
   - The Emergency Services Agent notifies the Leader Agent, who then informs all other agents.
3. **Bandwidth Adjustment**:
   - The Online Gaming Agent reduces bandwidth to ensure the Emergency Services Agent can allocate up to 50 Mbps.
   - The Video Streaming Agent adjusts video quality and reduces bandwidth as necessary.
   - The IoT Management Agent ensures minimal impact on device connectivity while adjusting bandwidth.

### Conclusion
By following this detailed plan, we can ensure efficient and fair management of the 1 Gbps bandwidth pool, prioritizing critical services during emergencies while maintaining a high-quality user experience for all applications. Regular monitoring and coordination will help maintain network stability and performance.
