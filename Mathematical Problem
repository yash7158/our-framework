Certainly! Let's compile the detailed results from each expert and determine the common value(s) of \( N \) that satisfy all conditions:

### Problem One: Algebra Expert
**Find possible integer values of \( N \) based on the equation \( 2x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 = 0 \) with \( x = \sqrt{N} \).**

- **Result**: The Algebra Expert concluded that there are no integer values of \( N \) that satisfy this equation. Therefore, no solutions from this problem.

### Problem Two: Number Theory Expert
**Identify prime numbers \( N \) such that \( N \) and \( N + 2 \) are both prime (twin primes) and ensure that \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).**

- **Result**: The Number Theory Expert found the following possible values of \( N \):
  - \( 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 67, 71, 79, 83, 103, 107, 131, 139, 151, 167, 179, 191, \ldots \)

### Problem Three: Combinatorics Expert
**Solve for \( N \) in the equation \( C(N, 3) = 364 \).**

- **Result**: The Combinatorics Expert found that:
  - \( N = 14 \)

### Problem Four: Calculus Expert
**Evaluate the definite integral \( \int_0^\pi \sin(Nx) \, dx = 0 \).**

- **Result**: The Calculus Expert determined that \( N \) must be an integer. Since the integral of \( \sin(Nx) \) over \( [0, \pi] \) is zero for any integer \( N \), all integers satisfy this condition.

### Problem Five: Geometry Expert
**Determine the integer values of \( N \) such that a regular polygon with \( N \) sides has an internal angle that is an integer number of degrees. Use the formula \( \alpha = (1 - 2/N) \times 180^\circ \).**

- **Result**: The Geometry Expert provided the following list of possible values of \( N \):
  - \( 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360 \)

### Compilation of Results
- **Number Theory**: \( N = 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 67, 71, 79, 83, 103, 107, 131, 139, 151, 167, 179, 191, \ldots \)
- **Combinatorics**: \( N = 14 \)
- **Calculus**: All integers
- **Geometry**: \( N = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360 \)

### Common Values
- The only value from Combinatorics is \( N = 14 \).
- \( N = 14 \) is not in the list provided by the Geometry Expert.
- There are no integer values of \( N \) that satisfy the equation from Algebra.

### Conclusion
Since there is no common value of \( N \) that satisfies all the given conditions, the final conclusion is:

**There is no integer value of \( N \) that satisfies all the given conditions.**
